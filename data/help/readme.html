				<H3>4. Using TK Editor</H3>
				<BLOCKQUOTE> Press <b><u>F1 for HELP</u></b>!
					<H4>About mouse</H4>
					<li>
					You can choose different block for both left and right mouse buttons.
					<li>
						Choose wall for button1 and floor for button2. It makes things easier.
						<H4>
							Here is easy tutorial for editor usage:
						</H4>
						<h5>Step 1 --</h5>
					<li>
					Create a new level by pressing F4 or load existing file by pressing F3.
					<li>
					Level x-size and y-size are in blocks.
					<li>
						Block currently selected for right button will be used to fill the new level.
						<h5>Step 2 --</h5>
					<li>
					Design and build the walls and floor.
					<li>
					If you want to fill a big area with one blocktype you should use selections.
					<li>
					Hold CTRL key down to make new selections.
					<li>
					You can also add areas to selection by holding SHIFT key down and remove areas 
					by holding ALT key down.
					<li>
					With right mouse button you can make "magic" selections.
					<li>
						When ready, add some lights and steams with Q and W keys.
						<h5>Step 3 --</h5>
					<li>
						Press Enter and edit block heights just to make your level look better.
						<h5>Step 4 --</h5>
					<li>
						Place some starting places for players by pressing P (at least 4 recommended).
						<h5>Step 5 --</h5>
					<li>
					Press F6 and edit general level variables.
					<li>
					Enemies here will be randomly set on level.
					<li>
						You can also place enemies to certain places by pressing E.
						<h5>Step 6 --</h5>
					<li>
					You can edit crate (weapon, bullet, energy) data by pressing F7 or F8 (these 
					crates will be randomly set on level).
					<li>
						You can also place crates with mouse to any place on level by using A and Z 
						keys.
						<h5>Step 7 --</h5>
					<li>
						Press F2 or CTRL-S to save the level !
						<h5>Step 8 --</h5>
					<li>
						Run TK and test your level...
						<H4>How to make your own EPISODES?</H4>
						<P>1. Make some levels and name files LEVEL1.LEV,LEVEL2.LEV...LEVEL999.LEV.
						</P>
						<P>2. Make new directory under LEVS directory eg. LEVS\DEATH
						</P>
						<P>3. Move your LEVELx.LEV files to directory
						</P>
						<P>4. Run game and start 1pl or 2pl game... your episode should be found at the 
							Choose Episode Menu. Select and KILL ALL!!!!
						</P>
						<H4>How to use your own graphics for your own levels and episodes?</H4>
						<P>1. Use efpconv to convert ingame graphics to some other format (like .bmp)
						</P>
						<P>2. Modify graphics as you like but keep 8-bit palette always the same. Remember 
							that you don't need to modify graphics with "generated" in them. Just deleting 
							them will do. They will be regenerated when needed next time.
						</P>
						<P>3. Save graphics to the directory where you are going to have your episode or 
							level.
						</P>
						<P>4. Use efpconv to convert your graphics back to efp format.
						</P>
						<P>5. Create default.ini (in case of an episode) or XXX.ini (in case of a level) 
							where XXX is the name of the level.<br>
							<code>e.g. levs\myepisode\default.ini or levs\myepisode\level6.ini</code>
						</P>
						<P>6. Add entries from default.ini (located in TK root directory) to your own .ini 
							file. You don't need copy all of them. Just what you need.
						</P>
						<P>7. Modify entries to include your graphics file.
						</P>
						<UL>
							<LI>
								<P><STRONG>Create entries also for files to be generated</STRONG> (you must have 
									new GameSpriteWalls_X and GameSpriteWall2 entries&nbsp;if you change 
									GameSpriteWalls and&nbsp;GameSpriteFloor2 if you change GameSpriteFloor).
								</P>
							<LI>
								<P>You don't need to have those files ready because TK will generate them if they 
									are missing. If you for some reason happen to corrupt some of your original 
									graphic files (those with "generated" in the name), you can safely delete those 
									and play some default&nbsp;episode. That will regenerate those files.</P>
							</LI>
						</UL>
						<P>
							<code>e.g. line from original&nbsp;TK\default.ini (do not modify this):<br>
								GameSpriteWallClr = efps/polycolr.efp<br>
								<br>
								your TK\levs\myepisode\default.ini<br>
								GameSpriteWallClr = levs\myepisode\mypolycolr.efp<br>
						</P>
						</CODE>
						<P>8. Use editor to create/modify levels with new graphics.
						</P>
						<P>9. Test it with TK!
						</P>
						<P>Note! When TK loads ingame graphics before each level, it looks the level 
							spesific .ini file for the file information, then episode spesific and after 
							that the default .ini file if info is not found. Therefore you can always 
							include to your .ini file only those entries, which you need to change.</P>
						<P>This also makes possible to use some graphics in the episode set by episode 
							spesific default.ini file and override the setting for a level with level 
							spesific .ini file.</P>

				<H3>5. Using efpconv.exe:</H3>
				<p>efpconv.exe is commandline image converter tool to convert images to and from 
					efp format. It supports only 8-bit images because TK itself supports currently 
					only 8-bits. Usage is simple: <blockquote> 1. Open command prompt<br>
						2. change to directory where you want to convert files<br>
						3. run efpconv.exe with source and destination files as parameters.<br>
					</blockquote>
				Example shown here. It has two different conversions:<p>
