Requirements:

SDL, SDL_image, SDL_mixer, SDL_net, libgtk (for Editor to work)

Build instructions (currently tested on Linux only):

./waf configure
./waf build
./waf install

The "./waf install" command will install files under the bin directory of
current working directory. 

1) Rename wavs/kickhead.WAV to wavs/kickhead.wav
2) Rename fnts/8X8B.FNT to fnts/8x8b.fnt

After all this you should be ready for the game.
