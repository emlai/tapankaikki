Requirements:

SDL, SDL_image, SDL_mixer, SDL_net, libgtk (for Editor to work)

Build instructions (currently tested on Linux only):

./waf configure
./waf build
./waf install

The "./waf install" command will install files under the bin directory of
current working directory. 

After all this you should be ready for the game.


Build instructions for Windows:

Set the environment variable SDLDIR to point to the directory where you
installed the SDL headers and libraries, for example:

setx SDLDIR C:\path\to\SDL-1.2.15

Open src\tk.sln in Visual Studio. Build. Copy SDL .dll files to build
directory if needed.
