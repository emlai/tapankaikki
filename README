Requirements:

SDL, SDL_image, SDL_mixer, SDL_net, libgtk (for Editor to work)

Build instructions (currently tested on Linux only):

./waf configure
./waf build
./waf install

The "./waf install" command will install files under the bin directory of
current working directory. You can copy the binary files from there to your TK4
folder. Note that you need to have the latest TK 4.0.8 version installed and
you also need to do the following renames in order for it to work:

1) Rename wavs/kickhead.WAV to wavs/kickhead.wav
2) Rename fnts/8X8B.FNT to fnts/8x8b.fnt

After all this you should be ready for the game.
