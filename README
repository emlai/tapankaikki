Requirements:

SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer, SDL2_net, libgtk (for Editor to work)

Build instructions (currently tested on Linux only):

./waf configure
./waf build
./waf install

The "./waf install" command will install files under the bin directory of
current working directory. 

After all this you should be ready for the game.
